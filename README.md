A free and open documentation platform built with [Laravel][laravel] and [Filament][filament], enhanced by [Ollama][ollama] for local AI features, focused on clarity, structure, and self-hosted simplicity.

> Please note that **Noton** is still under active development

## Installation

See [setup instructions][setup] for how to self-host Noton with [Docker][docker] or run it locally.

## Local AI

Noton integrates with [Ollama][ollama] to provide **private**, local AI features.
All prompts and answers stay on your own server â€“ no external API calls are made.

> Please note that AI models are resource-intensive, you may need to choose a model that fits your host
